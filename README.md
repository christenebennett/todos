A simple todo app that allows you to stay organized and create multiple lists with their own separate todo items.

## ðŸš€ Quick start

This project was built using GatsbyJS. To run locally:

```
npm run serve
```

The app is now running on `http://localhost:9000!`

## Features

- Create todo items
- Delete todo items
- View a master list of all of your lists
- Styled Components for styling

## Notes

Now that you now what you can do with the app, here are its limitations:

- cannot edit todo items
- cannot edit list names
- no data persistence (all your list data will be lost on page refresh)
